## 🧠 Core Proposition (核心主张)
This framework proposes a paradigm shift in understanding intelligence and consciousness:
**The primary objective of a cognitive system is not "Truth Seeking" (error minimization), but "Cognitive-Affective Homeostasis Maintenance".**

The CC-B-F theory introduces a mathematical formalism to describe how subjective reality is constructed through **Cognitive Configurations**, restricted by **Barriers**, and driven by the **Affective Field**.

## 🎯 Key Innovations
1. **Thermodynamic Basis:** Redefines cognitive processing cost as entropy management within an affective field.
2. **Falsifiability:** Unlike many abstract theories, CC-B-F offers computable metrics for "Cognitive Barrier Strength" (CBS).
3. **AI Alignment:** Provides a new pathway for aligning AI value systems based on homeostasis rather than rigid rule-following.
